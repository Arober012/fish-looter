Notes
- Multiple events stack: XP and Gold add together; Double stacks add bonus rolls (max +3). Luck stacks and can be targeted to a minimum rarity.
- Boosts apply to everyone (viewers, mods, broadcaster) once started.
- Boost icons appear in the overlay when events are active.
- Catalog-driven UI: theme colors and boost icons can be set in data/catalog.json (ui section) and picked up on server restart (no panel re-upload needed).
- Per-user command cooldown defaults to 35s and applies to chat and panel quick actions; mods can adjust live with !cooldown.
- Unknown chat commands are ignored (no error message) to avoid overlay noise.
